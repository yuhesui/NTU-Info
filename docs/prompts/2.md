You have effectively infinite token/context length: deeply analyze the entire repository and keep all constraints consistent across code + docs. Before finalizing changes, ALWAYS double-check:
- All hard constraints in this prompt are satisfied
- The project runs end-to-end
- Tests pass (run them and fix failures)
- Outputs are written exactly where required

PRINT-OUT VERIFICATION
----------------------
To prove you executed this prompt and to help verification, your final message must include the exact string:
PROMPT_VERIFICATION: yhs

YOUR ROLE
---------
You are the implementation agent for the GitHub repository `yuhesui/NTU-info`. Your task is to modify the website so the specified homepage sections, banner tabs, and feature entry points are present, accessible, and styled consistently with the current design system.

SCOPE
-----
In this run, implement ONLY the information architecture + homepage structure work needed to guarantee the following sections and navigation items exist and render correctly:
- A multi-tab banner navigation with persistent selected state (not hover-only).
- Homepage “Essential Student Tools” section with a strict 3-card first row and remaining cards in a second row.
- Homepage “2 cards” section that is exactly two equal-width cards on desktop and stacks on mobile.
- Banner tab placement that keeps “Exam Timetable” in a different banner tab (not in the Tools tab and not in the Essential Tools first row).
- Site entry points for:
    - Math Notes
    - Clubs & Societies Explorer
    - CGPA Calculator
    - Airport Guide (EN/ZH i18n-ready placement)
    - Incoming placeholders: Canteen Food Rating Guide, MOOC Mapping Tools (navigation + placeholder pages only).

HARD CONSTRAINTS (non-negotiable)
---------------------------------
- Do not rely on `./archived/` at runtime; anything needed must be copied/refactored into `public/` and referenced from there.
- Do not implement hover-only navigation; banner tabs and menus must be keyboard and touch operable.
- Always keep the selected banner tab visually indicated (“always shown selection”), and persist it across reloads using localStorage (key: `ntuinfo.banner.activeTab`).
- Homepage layout must meet breakpoints 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px without layout shifts.
- “Essential Student Tools” must have exactly these three cards in the FIRST ROW, in this exact order:
    1) MathNotes
    2) Clubs & Societies Explorer
    3) CGPA Calculator
- Exam Timetable must be accessible via the banner, but placed under a different top-level tab than Tools (e.g., Academics).
- The homepage “2 cards” section must be exactly two equal-width cards on desktop (50/50) and stack on mobile (100% each) with consistent spacing.
- Keep root documentation rules intact: do not add new root-level docs; only update root README.md if needed.
- All changes must be committed with clear, atomic commits; branch naming must follow `fix/ntuinfo-<desc>` or `refactor/ntuinfo-<desc>`.

BANNER TABS / INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (must implement)
-------------------------------------------------------
Implement a banner tab system with top-level tabs and panels (accessible pattern with ARIA):
Top-level tabs (minimum):
- Academics (should contain multiple academic items)
- Tools
- Guides
- Campus Life
- About

Required items under tabs (minimum):
- Academics:
    - Exam Timetable
    - MOOC Mapping Tools (placeholder page + link)
    - (Optional) STARS / Course Reg guide placeholder link
- Tools:
    - CGPA Calculator
    - Math Notes & Past Papers
    - Clubs & Societies Explorer
- Guides:
    - Airport Guide (link to page; i18n implementation can be stubbed in this run if needed, but nav + page must exist)
- Campus Life:
    - NTU Canteen Food Rating Guide (placeholder page + link)
    - (Optional) cross-link to Clubs Explorer
- About:
    - Minimal about content / repo link (no heavy copy)

Rules:
- Tab selection must be click/tap + keyboard (Enter/Space), Escape closes panel, and selected tab is always visibly highlighted.
- Selection persists via localStorage; default to Academics (or the current Home-equivalent) on first load.

HOMEPAGE SECTIONS (must be present)
-----------------------------------
A) Essential Student Tools section (homepage)
- Must be a grid with:
    - Row 1: 3 cards (MathNotes, Clubs Explorer, CGPA) in that exact order.
    - Row 2: remaining cards (e.g., Airport Guide, etc.).
- If possible, base the card CSS on the existing “Clubs & Societies Explorer” card style for consistency.

B) Two-card section (homepage)
- Must exist as a dedicated section with exactly two cards:
    - Desktop: 2 columns (50/50), equal visual weight.
    - Mobile: stacked 1 column.
- Ensure consistent gap spacing and no overflow/misalignment.

C) Exam Timetable placement
- Ensure Exam Timetable is NOT part of the Essential Student Tools first row and NOT under Tools tab.

PLACEHOLDER PAGES (must exist)
------------------------------
Create minimal placeholder pages (simple layout + “Coming soon” + short scope note):
- `public/pages/mooc-mapping.html` (MOOC mapping tools)
- `public/pages/canteens.html` (canteen food rating guide)

Add both to banner navigation in the correct tabs.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (must be satisfied before finishing)
---------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Banner contains the required top-level tabs and required items under each.
- [ ] Selected banner tab is always visibly highlighted and persists across reloads.

- [ ] Exam Timetable is reachable from banner but placed under a different tab than Tools.
- [ ] Placeholder pages exist and are reachable from the banner.
- [ ] Final message includes: PROMPT_VERIFICATION: yhs
